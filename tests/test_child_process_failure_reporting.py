"""Contracts for what a dying recorder child process tells its parent.

A recording runs its writers as separate processes. When one of them raises
during startup, the parent used to learn only an exit code, and the reason lived
in whatever the child's stderr happened to reach. That cost a full diagnosis
cycle for a failure that was fully explained in the child. Worse, a child left
running after such a failure keeps the standard output it inherited open and
stops the parent's own interpreter from exiting, so the failure never gets
reported at all.

These tests pin three things:

- a child's traceback reaches the parent and lands in the error the parent
  raises,
- a child that ignores a stop request is killed rather than waited on forever,
- a queue whose reader is gone does not hold the parent open.

They need no display, listeners, or injected input.

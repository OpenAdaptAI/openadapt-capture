# OpenAdapt Capture design

## Product role

`openadapt-capture` is the canonical native recorder for OpenAdapt. It records
screen media, native input, timing, window geometry, and optional action-time UI
structure into one local session. `openadapt-flow` consumes the session, applies
the compiler and qualification contracts, and owns governed replay.

Capture has no static Experimental, Beta, or Production package label. It is a
stable component with one canonical native role. A successful unit test,
runnable package, or newest PyPI version does not select a Production default.
A release becomes selectable for a Production claim scope only through an
active, signed entry in the
[production admission ledger](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/.github/blob/main/production-lifecycle-admissions.json).
An inactive release is not actively admitted. Exact-commit clean-install and
interactive native qualification provide the evidence for admission.

Capture is local-first. It does not upload a recording. A raw session can
contain screen text, typed secrets, accessibility text, and optional narration.
It remains inside the approved local boundary unless a separate explicit
operation exports it.

## Supported recording paths

| Path | Capture contract |
| --- | --- |
| Full virtual desktop | Capture the combined MSS desktop and translate global input into that exact pixel space. |
| One native window | Re-resolve and capture the selected window on each frame; translate input into a fixed encoded viewport. |
| RDP or Citrix client window | Use the native window path. Treat the remote application as pixels; local accessibility APIs do not cross the remote boundary. |
| Browser | `openadapt-flow` owns the supported Playwright recorder. The Chrome extension and bridge in this repository are source-only development prototypes and are excluded from Capture release artifacts. |

Capture supports native input observation on macOS, Windows, and X11 Linux.
It retains action-time structure through Windows UI Automation, macOS
Accessibility, and Linux AT-SPI when the local provider is available. The
public structural protocol also accepts an injected read-only provider.

## Session pipeline

One recording has these stages:

1. Resolve and verify all required local dependencies before input listeners
   start. This includes a real encode-and-decode probe when video is enabled.
2. Resolve the initial native-window or virtual-desktop coordinate scope.
3. Create the per-capture SQLite database and media staging path.
4. Observe native input and screen frames on separate workers.
5. Put all observed events onto one timestamped processing queue.
6. Associate actionable input with the preceding screen observation and
   optional structural observation.
7. Stream RGB frames to a separately provisioned FFmpeg process.
8. Close, verify, and atomically promote the MP4. Retain an incomplete partial
   file on an encoder failure and never report it as complete media.
9. Post-process raw input into the public action view.

A worker failure stops the session and propagates through the recording
boundary. A frame whose size violates the fixed stream contract is an error. It
is not silently skipped.

## Coordinate contracts

### Full virtual desktop

MSS monitor zero is the bounding rectangle of all active monitors. Native input
uses global desktop coordinates. Capture stores:

- `coordinate_space = "virtual_desktop_pixels"`
- the combined desktop origin and viewport
- the physical monitor count
- privacy-safe physical monitor rectangles

For each input point, Capture subtracts the combined desktop origin. This maps
negative-origin secondary monitors into the exact captured frame without a
fabricated per-monitor scale. A converter must not apply the legacy
`pixel_ratio` scale to this coordinate space.

The desktop topology is fixed for one recording. Display hot-plug, rotation,
resolution, or scale changes alter the encoded frame contract and fail the
session. Multiple monitors are supported when the topology stays unchanged.

### Native window

The first successful frame fixes the encoded viewport. Capture then re-resolves
the selected window for each frame. It retains the current bounds, source
viewport, source-to-output scale, letterbox content rectangle, and change
timeline.

When the window moves, resizes, or moves between displays with different
scales, Capture scales the complete source frame to fit the fixed encoded
viewport and adds letterboxing as required. It maps input with the same current
bounds and content rectangle. It does not discard a frame because the source
window changed size.

Input outside the selected window remains out of range. Capture does not clamp
it into a valid-looking target coordinate.

Current sessions declare `openadapt.capture.window-scoped/v2`. Each frame has a
monotonic geometry generation. Capture persists the frame and its WindowEvent
at one timestamp. Every pointer or keyboard action references that timestamp
and generation. The compiler must reject a missing or mismatched v2 binding. It
must not select geometry by a nearest-time estimate.

Each frame binds the native window handle to the owner PID, process start time,
and platform coordinate source. Capture resolves the identity and bounds on
both sides of the frame grab. It publishes a monotonic geometry generation only
after the frame and its WindowEvent enter the ordered event queue. Every action
re-resolves the live target and records the exact published generation.
An action during an unobserved move, resize, process replacement, or handle
reuse fails the session.

Windows accepts DWM extended-frame bounds only. It does not fall back to the
DPI-virtualized `GetWindowRect` coordinate space. Linux window scope uses
native X11 EWMH identity and root-pixel geometry. A native Wayland session
fails closed until a compositor portal can supply the same stable contract.

## Native input

Capture records these primitive event classes:

- mouse move
- mouse button press and release
- mouse scroll
- key press and release

Platform observers have one ordered callback contract. They identify injected
events when the operating system provides that information. Capture can exclude
its own injected qualification events from a normal session. It refuses an
incomplete observer startup instead of reporting partial coverage as complete.

The post-processing layer merges primitive events into higher-level actions.
The compiler remains responsible for refusing action forms that its selected
backend cannot replay safely.

## Structural observations

Structural observations are optional evidence beside an action. The versioned
schema can retain:

- provider and query type
- element role, name, AutomationId, class, framework, bounds, and patterns
- process and top-level window identity
- bounded ancestry
- exact candidate cardinality and its matching fields

The package creates a Windows UIA, macOS Accessibility, or Linux AT-SPI
observer for the current platform. A missing optional field stays missing.
Capture does not infer an accessibility value from a screenshot, coordinate,
or neighboring control. Provider text has strict length and depth bounds. A
transient provider failure omits the optional observation without corrupting
the screen and input evidence.

The Linux provider uses the modern GObject AT-SPI binding. The `linux` package
extra installs PyGObject. The host supplies the AT-SPI typelib/runtime and an
interactive desktop accessibility bus.

The native provider describes the local accessibility tree. It does not
describe controls inside an RDP or Citrix pixel stream.

## Video and frame timing

Capture does not import, link, download, or bundle FFmpeg. It invokes an
explicitly configured, Desktop-provisioned, or user-provisioned executable
through a process boundary. Preflight verifies the required raw-video input,
selected encoder, MP4 muxing, PNG encode/decode, `image2pipe`, and `select`
filter before recording starts.

The writer emits a deterministic constant-rate stream. It reuses the preceding
RGB frame for a missing integer PTS slot. A compact MP4 metadata box binds
logical capture timestamps to decoded frame indexes. Final verification decodes
a real frame from the staged artifact before the file is promoted.

Capture uses SQLite for events and the filesystem for media. The current media
contract is one MP4 per recording. The package does not claim video chunking,
automatic retention, or crash resume.

## Audio boundary

Microphone narration is off by default. When enabled, Capture requires an
installed on-device transcription backend before it opens the microphone. It
does not use a remote fallback. It discards the waveform after transcription
unless the operator explicitly enables waveform retention.

Transcript text is unsanitized. A retained waveform is biometric data. Neither
is safe for automatic egress.

## Browser boundary

The supported browser recorder remains Playwright-native in `openadapt-flow`.
It needs one owner for the browser context, DOM identity, field geometry,
ordered before/after frames, page state, and source-time secret redaction.

The Chrome extension is a repository-only research prototype. It does not own
the complete browser contract, and Capture does not package or promote it.
Browser recording stays in Flow because DOM identity, field geometry,
navigation, source-time secret exclusion, and browser-context ownership are
load-bearing inputs to compilation and replay.

The extension and its unauthenticated development bridge are repository-only.
Wheel and source archives exclude the bridge and its legacy direct replay. The
production package keeps only the passive browser-event schemas needed to read
old local captures.

## Release qualification

The production release workflow is manual and binds evidence to one exact
commit. It must:

- build and validate one wheel and sdist;
- install and uninstall that exact wheel in a clean environment on Linux,
  macOS, and Windows;
- run interactive native qualification on labeled Linux, macOS, and Windows
  hosts with real display and input permissions;
- require at least two real monitors on each interactive host;
- run the complete slow native capture tests with no skip;
- verify live window movement and resize where the operating system supports
  window-scoped capture; and
- retain machine-readable test and topology evidence.

The release workflow accepts only a successful, complete job set for its exact
commit. Missing, stale, skipped, partial, or failed evidence blocks publication.
Publication does not select a Production default. The signed admission ledger
binds an exact published release to its approved claim scope and evidence.

## Known boundaries

- A visible logged-in desktop session and operating-system permissions are
  required.
- Windows and X11 window capture use a screen-region grab and require an
  unobstructed target window.
- A display-topology change requires a new recording.
- Browser extension capture is a repository-only development prototype. Its
  bridge and direct replay are not in release artifacts. It is not the
  supported browser recorder.
- A raw capture is sensitive and has no automatic safe-for-egress derivative.
- Customer RDP and Citrix environments require their own task-specific
  qualification.

"""OpenAdapt's original, hand-built recorder — the live recording engine.

This is the production recorder carried forward from OpenAdapt's record.py:
the most battle-tested recording code in the org, refined against years of
real desktop workflows. It is the recorder behind OpenAdapt's desktop path
(openadapt-flow ``record --backend windows|rdp`` wraps ``Recorder``).

Architecture: a multiprocessing pipeline. Native platform input observers feed
normalized mouse/keyboard events into synchronized queues; dedicated writer processes
persist action events, screenshots, video frames, and (optionally) audio and
window state into a per-capture SQLite database plus time-aligned media files.
Adapted from the original for per-capture databases. Importing this module
must never touch the display (no screenshot at module scope — enforced by
tests/test_headless_import.py).

Usage:

    $ python -m openadapt_capture.recorder "<description of task>"

class Recorder:
    """High-level recording interface.

    Wraps the legacy ``record()`` function with a clean Python API:

    - Constructor parameters override config defaults (``capture_video``, etc.)
    - Runtime introspection (``event_count``, ``is_recording``)
    - Post-recording access to ``CaptureSession``

    Usage::

        with Recorder('./my_capture', task_description='Demo task',
                       capture_video=True, capture_audio=False) as recorder:

    Window-scoped recording (record ONE window in its own pixel space —
    frames captured from that window, input coordinates translated into the
    captured frame's pixels; see ``window_capture.py``)::

        with Recorder('./my_capture', task_description='Citrix demo',

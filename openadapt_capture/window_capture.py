"""Window-scoped capture: record ONE window in that window's own pixel space.

Why this exists (the Citrix / remote-display wedge): openadapt-flow's
``RemoteDisplayBackend`` (``record --backend rdp``, ``rdp_window`` mode)
*replays* against the pixels of a single client window (Parallels, Citrix
Workspace, Microsoft Remote Desktop) captured per-window — on macOS via
``CGWindowListCreateImage`` by window id. A demonstration recorded FULL-SCREEN
is in a different coordinate space than that replay surface, so converters had
to work around the mismatch (record inside the session, or full-screen the
client). Window-scoped recording removes the mismatch at the source: frames
are captured in the target window's pixel space and input coordinates are
translated into that same space at capture time.

Coordinate semantics (kept in exact parity with openadapt-flow
``backends/remote_display.py`` — read that module before changing these):

- ``bounds`` is ``(x, y, w, h)`` in **screen points**, top-left origin — the
  space native platform observers use for global mouse coordinates.
- A captured frame contains the window's own **pixels** (macOS:
  ``CGWindowListCreateImage`` with ``kCGWindowImageBoundsIgnoreFraming`` — the
  identical call flow's replay capture path uses).
- ``scale`` = captured pixel width / bounds width (e.g. 2.0 on Retina).
- Replay maps a captured pixel to a screen point as
  ``screen = bounds_origin + pixel / scale`` (flow's ``_to_screen``).
  Recording therefore maps a global screen point to a window pixel as the
  exact inverse: ``pixel = (screen - bounds_origin) * scale``
  (:func:`translate_point`).

Importing this module must never touch the display (platform bindings are
imported lazily inside the resolver/capturer functions), preserving the
package's headless-import invariant (tests/test_headless_import.py).
